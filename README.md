## Abstract

In this diploma project, a concept for the conversion of a commercially available walking aid into
an iWalk was developed. The aim is to record health data as well as detecting potentially hazardous
falls and ensuring quick help for elderly people. Steps are also counted and a stress analysis is
performed. All data can be accessed via an app.
The project was divided into the following four divisions: Mechanics, programming and sensor
and electrical engineering.
